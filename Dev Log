Development Log

Day 1: 5/10/16
- Created Node class and constructor
- Created Location class

Day 2: 5/12/16
- Added a dev log! 
- Added getters/setters in Node
- Created AStarPathFinder class
	- Set up instance variables and constructor
	- Created calculateHeuristic() which calculates the heuristic for every node on the grid
	
Day 3: 5/16/16
- Created calculateMoveCostAndFVal() which finds the move cost and f value for the locations
    directly bordering a given location
- Created findLeastFVal() which loops through the openList to find the node with the least f value
	- This is meant to be used to find the next node for the A* Pathfinder to go to 

Day 4: 5/17/16
- Created and set up display systems for each of the classes
	- got grid to display 
	- mouse click recognition
	
Day 5: 5/19/16
- Created method to create blocks on the grid
- Fine tuned block creation/mouse click recognition

Day 6: 5/23/16
- Identified errors in grid displaying
- Thought about how to display shortest path
- Thought about order to run AStarPathFinder methods in Main

Day 7: 5/24/16
- Created node repointing system so that the pathfinder constantly looks for the shortest path
- Added keyboard recognition
- Created loop within main that should theoretically find the shortest path to the target location and color it in
- fixed bug where location variables were not accessible 
- found bug where the code stops running when it hits the first while loop in main 

To do: 
get loop to run... then it should work?
